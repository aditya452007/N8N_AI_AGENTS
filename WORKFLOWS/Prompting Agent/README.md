# Prompting Agent Workflows

This directory contains n8n workflows designed to help you generate high-quality, structured prompts for AI agents and LLMs.

## 🚀 Workflows

### 1. Prompt Generator Agent
**File:** `Prompt_Generator_Agent.json`

This is an interactive AI agent that interviews the user to understand their specific needs and then generates a highly optimized, structured prompt. It uses a series of forms to collect initial details, generates relevant follow-up questions using Google Gemini, and then compiles everything into a professional prompt.

#### How it works:
1.  **Form Trigger**: Starts the workflow when the user accesses the n8n form.
2.  **Base Questions**: Asks the user for initial details:
    *   What do you want to build?
    *   Tools available (e.g., Web Search, Email).
    *   Expected input.
    *   Expected output.
3.  **Related Question AI**: Uses **Google Gemini** to analyze the user's input and generate 3 specific follow-up questions to clarify context, tone, or constraints.
4.  **Loop & Ask**: Loops through the generated questions and presents them to the user one by one via forms (`RelevantQuestions`).
5.  **Merge User Intent**: Combines the initial answers and the follow-up answers.
6.  **Prompt Generator**: Uses **Google Gemini** again to take all the gathered information and generate a final, structured prompt following best practices (Role, Inputs, Tools, Instructions, Constraints, Conclusions).
7.  **Sending Prompt**: Displays the final generated prompt to the user.

#### Requirements:
*   **Google Gemini (PaLM) API Key**: For the AI logic (generating questions and the final prompt).
*   **n8n Forms**: This workflow relies heavily on n8n's Form nodes to interact with the user.

#### Usage:
1.  Activate the workflow.
2.  Open the `On form submission` node or the Production URL for the workflow.
3.  Fill out the initial form.
4.  Answer the follow-up questions generated by the AI.
5.  Copy the final structured prompt for your own use.
